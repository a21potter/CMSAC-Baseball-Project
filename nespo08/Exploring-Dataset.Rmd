```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Load Dataset

```{r}
library(baseballr)
library(tidyverse)

statcast_data_all <- read_rds("data/statcast_data_clean.rds")

# Clean names

statcast_data_all %>%
  janitor::clean_names()
```
## TEMP: Filter for 2020-22

```{r}
statcast_data_2020_to_22 <- statcast_data_all %>%
  filter(game_date >= "2020-04-01")
```


## EDA

```{r}
# Counts and percentages of variables by shift type and pitcher/batter matchups

  filter(!if_fielding_alignment == "", !of_fielding_alignment == "") %>%
  #select(stand, p_throws, if_fielding_alignment, of_fielding_alignment) %>%
  count(stand, p_throws, if_fielding_alignment, of_fielding_alignment) %>%
  mutate(prob = n/sum(n))

# Counts and percentages of variables by combination of shift type and pitcher/batter matchups

  filter(!if_fielding_alignment == "", !of_fielding_alignment == "") %>%
